# assignments

These notebooks are examples of some of the assignments I completed during my Master in Applied Artifical Intelligence at Deakin University.
The notebooks related to predicting pedestrain traffic were written from scratch, as part of my keystone project.
The others highlight some of the interesting topics covered. The notebooks were not written from scratch by me - they were provided with some text, direction and outlines.
