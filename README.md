# assignments

These notebooks are examples of some of the assignments I completed during my Master in Applied Artifical Intelligence at Deakin University.<br>
The notebooks related to predicting pedestrain traffic were written from scratch, as part of my keystone project.<br>
The others highlight some of the interesting topics covered. Those notebooks were not written from scratch by me - they were provided with some text, direction and outlines.
